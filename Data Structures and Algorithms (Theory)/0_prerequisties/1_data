what is data ?

Data is the representation of sequential bytes . when data is organised it becomes the information

now, data structure is the systmatic way to organize the data so that it can be used efficiently.

example: arrays :  stores the similar type

data type : defines a certain domain of value
along with the values on it.

abstract data type : ADT are data type which defines operations on values using functions without specifying what is there inside the functions and how the operations are performed

example: stack ADT.

the stack have its own data storing technique and ots own operations.
like push(), pop(), isempty() etc.

the ADT hides the inner structure and design of the dta type from the user.

types of data structure:

linear and non linear.
